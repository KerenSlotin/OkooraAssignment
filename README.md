# run the following commands: 
## open the terminal
## cd RateFetcherPrinter
## dotnet restore
## dotnet build
## dotnet run
## on your browser open "http://localhost:5067/swagger/index.html"
## please note that the external api has rate limitation and therefore it doesn't always work best
## and also I increased the time the data is refreshed to 10 minutes instead of 10 seconds to prevent overloading on the external API
